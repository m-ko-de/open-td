## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm (fast package manager)
- For mobile development: Xcode (iOS) or Android Studio (Android)

### Installation

#### 1. Install pnpm (if not already installed)

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

#### 2. Clone repository and install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 3. Start development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The game will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

Build output will be in the `dist/` directory.

## 📱 Mobile Deployment

### Initialize Capacitor

```bash
pnpm cap:init
```

### iOS Build

```bash
# Add iOS platform
pnpm cap:add:ios

# Create build and sync
pnpm build:mobile

# Open Xcode
pnpm cap:open:ios
```

### Android Build

```bash
# Add Android platform
pnpm cap:add:android

# Create build and sync
pnpm build:mobile

# Open Android Studio
pnpm cap:open:android
```

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Place Towers**: Select a tower type from the bottom bar and click on an empty spot
2. **Earn Gold**: Destroy enemies to earn gold for more towers
3. **Upgrade Towers**: Click on placed towers to upgrade them (up to level 5) for better stats
4. **Sell Towers**: Right-click towers or use the sell button to get 70% gold refund
5. **Think Strategically**: Place towers where they can shoot enemies for as long as possible
6. **Choose Tower Types**: Each tower type has unique strengths (damage, range, special effects)
7. **Survive**: Protect your endpoint - if too many enemies get through, the game is over!

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Game Engine**: [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) - HTML5 Game Framework
- **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- **Language**: TypeScript - Type-Safe JavaScript
- **Mobile**: [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) - Cross-platform Native Runtime

## ⚠️ Global Error Handling & Auto-Restart

This project installs a lightweight global error handler in the browser that:

- Captures any uncaught errors and unhandled promise rejections
- Persists a short error report locally (and tries to upload to the server if you're logged-in)
- Attempts to restart the game automatically (up to 3 times within 30s to avoid loops)

If the application experiences repeated failures it will stop restarting automatically and show a small overlay explaining the problem. You can disable or adjust behavior by editing `src/client/ErrorReporter.ts` and the restart logic in `src/main.ts`.

## 📝 Development

### PNPM Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Create production build
- `pnpm preview` - Preview production build locally
- `pnpm cap:sync` - Sync Capacitor
- `pnpm build:mobile` - Build and sync for mobile

### Testing (non-interactive default)

- `pnpm run test` — Run the full test suite once and exit (non-interactive). This is the default command for automated checks and CI.
- `pnpm run test:watch` — Run the test runner in watch mode for development (interactive).
- `pnpm run test:ci` — Run tests with minimal output suitable for CI (dot reporter).

### Why pnpm?

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as package manager:

- ⚡ **Faster**: Up to 3x faster installation
- 💾 **Space Efficient**: Global shared store reduces disk space
- 🔒 **Secure**: Strict dependency resolution prevents phantom dependencies

### Further Development

The project provides a solid foundation for tower defense development with advanced features already implemented:

- ✅ **Tower Upgrade System**: Towers can be upgraded up to level 5 with increasing costs and improved stats
- ✅ **Tower Selling**: Sell towers for 70% refund of total invested gold
- ✅ **Multiple Tower Types**: 7 different tower types with unique abilities (Basic, Fast, Strong, Frost, Fire, Splash, Sniper)
- ✅ **Multiplayer Support**: Dedicated game server with Socket.io for real-time multiplayer
- ✅ **User Authentication**: Complete user registration and login system with persistent accounts
- ✅ **Mobile Deployment**: Capacitor support for iOS and Android native apps
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and CI/CD pipeline

**Future Enhancements:**

- Add new tower types in `src/entities/towers/`
- Create new enemy types in `src/entities/enemies/`
- Extend gameplay in `src/scenes/GameScene.ts`
- Add assets (images, sounds) and load them in `PreloaderScene.ts`
